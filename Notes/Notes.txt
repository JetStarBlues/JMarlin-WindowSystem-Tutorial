struct _Desktop {

	struct _Window window;  // Inherits window class
	uint16_t       mouse_x;
	uint16_t       mouse_y;

};

	" If you've never dealt with this design before, it's one of the cooler
	  legal hacks we can use in C to allow for a type of inheritance.

	  According to the C spec, the address of the first element of a struct
	  and the address of the struct itself will always be equivalent.

	  Therefore, by putting a Window at the beginning of the desktop struct
	  we can cast any Desktop pointer into a Window pointer and pass it
	  to any Window function without the function being any the wiser
